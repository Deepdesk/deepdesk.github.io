# Introduction

Deepdesk empowers agents with AI by giving real-time suggestions above the agent's input field during a conversation.

This documentation covers implementing the **Deepdesk JavaScript SDK** in a customer engagement platform.

The documentation assumes you have a Deepdesk account and the appropriate webhooks and athentication mechanism have been implemented in the platforms backend.

If you haven't set up athentication and message webhooks, please contact support@deepdesk.com.
